# Quiz: Module 6 - RNA Velocity

**10 Questions | Passing: 70%**

---

## Question 1
RNA velocity uses the ratio of:

- A) Expressed vs non-expressed genes
- B) Spliced vs unspliced RNA
- C) mRNA vs protein
- D) Nuclear vs cytoplasmic RNA

---

## Question 2
Unspliced RNA contains:

- A) Only exons
- B) Introns (not yet spliced out)
- C) Only UTRs
- D) Protein sequences

---

## Question 3
RNA velocity predicts:

- A) Past cell states
- B) Future cell states / direction of change
- C) Cell cycle phase only
- D) Mutation rates

---

## Question 4
Velocity arrows on a UMAP point toward:

- A) Higher gene expression
- B) Predicted future cell state
- C) The nearest neighbor
- D) Technical artifacts

---

## Question 5
To compute RNA velocity, you need:

- A) Only a count matrix
- B) Separate spliced and unspliced count matrices
- C) Protein abundance data
- D) ChIP-seq data

---

## Question 6
scVelo's "stochastic" model assumes:

- A) No noise in the data
- B) Constant transcription/splicing rates
- C) Only one gene is expressed
- D) Circular trajectories

---

## Question 7
scVelo's "dynamical" model:

- A) Is faster than stochastic
- B) Learns gene-specific kinetic parameters
- C) Requires labeled data
- D) Only works on small datasets

---

## Question 8
Chaotic/noisy velocity arrows suggest:

- A) Perfect differentiation trajectory
- B) Steady state cells or poor velocity estimation
- C) Too much data
- D) Correct root selection

---

## Question 9
Velocity data is typically generated using:

- A) Standard Cell Ranger
- B) velocyto or kallisto | bustools (lamanno workflow)
- C) FASTQC
- D) Manual counting

---

## Question 10
A limitation of RNA velocity is:

- A) Only works for 10x data
- B) Assumes specific splicing kinetics that may not hold for all genes
- C) Requires time-series data
- D) Cannot visualize results
