# Quiz: Module 2 - Pseudotime Concepts

**10 Questions | Passing: 70%**

---

## Question 1
What is pseudotime?

- A) Actual experimental time
- B) Computational ordering of cells along a biological process
- C) Processing time for analysis
- D) Cell cycle duration

---

## Question 2
Pseudotime analysis is appropriate when:

- A) Cells exist in discrete, unrelated states
- B) Cells progress through a continuous biological process
- C) All cells are identical
- D) You have time-series data only

---

## Question 3
The "root" cell in trajectory analysis represents:

- A) The largest cell
- B) The starting point of the biological process
- C) A randomly selected cell
- D) The cell with highest expression

---

## Question 4
Branching trajectories indicate:

- A) Technical errors
- B) Multiple possible cell fates / differentiation paths
- C) Poor data quality
- D) Incorrect clustering

---

## Question 5
A key assumption of pseudotime analysis is:

- A) All cells were collected at the same time
- B) The snapshot captures cells at different stages of a process
- C) Cells don't change over time
- D) Gene expression is constant

---

## Question 6
Why can't we use actual time in single-cell experiments?

- A) Cells are destroyed during sequencing (snapshot data)
- B) Time is not important
- C) Sequencing is instantaneous
- D) All cells are synchronized

---

## Question 7
Pseudotime values typically range from:

- A) -100 to 100
- B) 0 to 1 (or 0 to max, normalized)
- C) Only integers
- D) Negative values only

---

## Question 8
What biological processes are suitable for trajectory analysis?

- A) Static tissue samples
- B) Differentiation, development, cell cycle, activation
- C) Only embryonic development
- D) Only cancer

---

## Question 9
Selecting the wrong root cell results in:

- A) No trajectory
- B) Reversed or incorrect pseudotime ordering
- C) Better results
- D) Faster computation

---

## Question 10
Validating pseudotime ordering can be done by:

- A) Checking known early/late marker genes
- B) Measuring cell size
- C) Counting clusters
- D) Ignoring biology
