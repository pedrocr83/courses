## Question 1
What type of data does RNA-seq produce?

- A) Continuous measurements
- B) Non-negative integer counts
- C) Percentage values
- D) Binary presence/absence

---

## Question 2
What does "overdispersion" mean in the context of RNA-seq?

- A) Too many genes are expressed
- B) Variance exceeds the mean
- C) Data is normally distributed
- D) Samples are too similar

---

## Question 3
Why is the Poisson distribution inadequate for RNA-seq data?

- A) It only works for continuous data
- B) It assumes mean equals variance, which is rarely true
- C) It cannot handle negative values
- D) It is too computationally expensive

---

## Question 4
Which distribution is the backbone of DESeq2 and edgeR?

- A) Normal distribution
- B) Poisson distribution
- C) Negative binomial distribution
- D) Uniform distribution

---

## Question 5
What additional parameter does the negative binomial have compared to Poisson?

- A) Mean parameter
- B) Dispersion parameter
- C) Location parameter
- D) Scale parameter

---

## Question 6
Zero-inflated models are particularly relevant for:

- A) Bulk RNA-seq
- B) Single-cell RNA-seq
- C) Microarray data
- D) Proteomics

---

## Question 7
If a gene has mean expression of 100 and variance of 500, this suggests:

- A) Underdispersion
- B) Perfect Poisson behavior
- C) Overdispersion
- D) Normal distribution

---

## Question 8
What is the relationship between mean and variance in a Poisson distribution?

- A) Variance = Mean²
- B) Variance = Mean
- C) Variance = Mean / 2
- D) No relationship

---

## Question 9
In the negative binomial, higher dispersion means:

- A) Lower variance

- D) Smaller sample size needed

---

## Question 10
Why do RNA-seq count data typically show overdispersion?

- A) Sequencing errors only
