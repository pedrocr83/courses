# Quiz: Module 5 - Hypothesis Testing Fundamentals

**10 Questions | Passing: 70%**

---

## Question 1
What does the null hypothesis (H₀) typically state in DE analysis?

- A) The gene is differentially expressed
- B) There is no difference in expression between groups
- C) The p-value is less than 0.05
- D) The effect size is large

---

## Question 2
A p-value of 0.03 means:

- A) There is a 3% chance the null hypothesis is true
- B) 3% of genes are differentially expressed
- C) If H₀ is true, there's a 3% chance of seeing data this extreme
- D) The effect size is 0.03

---

## Question 3
What is a Type I error?

- A) Failing to detect a true difference
- B) Rejecting H₀ when it is actually true (false positive)
- C) A computational error
- D) Using the wrong statistical test

---

## Question 4
What is a Type II error?

- A) Failing to reject H₀ when it is false (false negative)
- B) Rejecting H₀ when it is true
- C) Using too many samples
- D) Incorrect normalization

---

## Question 5
Statistical power is:

- A) The probability of a Type I error
- B) The probability of detecting a true effect
- C) The p-value threshold
- D) The fold change magnitude

---

## Question 6
Which test is commonly used for comparing two groups of expression values?

- A) Chi-square test
- B) t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test
- C) ANOVA only
- D) Correlation test

---

## Question 7
A parametric test (like t-test) assumes:

- A) Data is normally distributed
- B) Data has no distribution
- C) Only integer values
- D) Equal sample sizes always

---

## Question 8
When is a Wilcoxon test preferred over a t-test?

- A) When data is normally distributed
- B) When data violates normality assumptions
- C) When sample size is very large
- D) When comparing more than 2 groups

---

## Question 9
What does a very small p-value (e.g., 1e-50) indicate?

- A) A biologically important gene
- B) Strong statistical evidence against H₀
- C) The largest effect size
- D) No need for multiple testing correction

---

## Question 10
Why is the p-value alone insufficient for assessing biological relevance?

- A) It doesn't account for effect size
- B) It's always too large
- C) It requires normal distribution
- D) It only works for bulk RNA-seq
