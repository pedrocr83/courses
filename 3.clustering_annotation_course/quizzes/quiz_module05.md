## Question 1
What does k-NN stand for in the context of clustering?

- A) k-Normalized Networks
- B) k-Nearest Neighbors
- C) Kernel Neural Networks
- D) k-Node Networks

---

## Question 2
The Leiden algorithm improves upon Louvain by:

- A) Being faster
- B) Guaranteeing connected communities
- C) Using fewer parameters
- D) Only working on small datasets

---

## Question 3
What does the "resolution" parameter control in Leiden clustering?

- A) Image quality of plots
- B) Number/size of clusters (higher = more clusters)
- C) Running time
- D) Memory usage

---

## Question 4
An SNN (Shared Nearest Neighbor) graph differs from k-NN by:

- A) Using fewer neighbors
- B) Weighting edges by shared neighbor overlap
- C) Being undirected
- D) Requiring labels

---

## Question 5
If you set resolution too high, you will likely:

- A) Merge distinct cell types
- B) Over-cluster, splitting real populations
- C) Get exactly the right number of clusters
- D) Crash the algorithm

---

## Question 6
If you set resolution too low, you will likely:

- A) Over-cluster rare populations
- B) Under-cluster, merging distinct cell types
- C) Get too many clusters
- D) Improve biological accuracy

---

## Question 7
The clustering input in Scanpy/Seurat is typically:

- A) Raw counts
- B) PCA embedding
- C) Gene names
- D) Cell annotations

---

## Question 8
What is modularity in community detection?

- A) Code organization
- B) Measure of within-cluster vs between-cluster connections
- C) Number of modules loaded
- D) GPU utilization

---

## Question 9
A good strategy for choosing resolution is:

- A) Always use 1.0
- B) Test multiple values and evaluate biologically
- C) Use the maximum possible value
- D) Let the algorithm decide automatically

---

## Question 10
