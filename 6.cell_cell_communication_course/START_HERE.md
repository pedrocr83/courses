# START HERE: Cell–Cell Communication Analysis

This is your **step-by-step path** through the course. Check items off as you complete them.

---

## 1) Setup

- [ ] Follow `setup.md` (R is the primary environment for CellChat/NicheNet; Python for CellPhoneDB/LIANA)
- [ ] Create folders:
  - [ ] `data/`
  - [ ] `results/`
  - [ ] `figures/`
- [ ] Copy templates:
  - [ ] `templates/ccc_report_template.md` → `results/ccc_report.md`
  - [ ] `templates/lr_database_comparison.md` → `results/lr_db_comparison.md`

---

## 2) Labs (Do in Order)

- [ ] `labs/lab01_lr_databases.Rmd`
- [ ] `labs/lab04_cellphonedb.Rmd`
- [ ] `labs/lab05_cellchat.Rmd`
- [ ] `labs/lab07_liana.Rmd`
- [ ] `labs/lab10_network_analysis.Rmd`

Save these outputs:
- [ ] database comparison notes (coverage, versions)
- [ ] interaction tables (top edges) + dotplots
- [ ] CellChat pathway/network plots + centrality summary
- [ ] LIANA consensus ranking table
- [ ] final network figure + interpretation bullets

---

## 3) Quizzes

- [ ] `quizzes/quiz_module01.md`
- [ ] `quizzes/quiz_module04.md`
- [ ] `quizzes/quiz_module05.md`
- [ ] `quizzes/quiz_module07.md`

---

## 4) Assignments

- [ ] `assignments/assignment1_data_preparation.md`
- [ ] `assignments/assignment2_tool_comparison.md`
- [ ] `assignments/assignment3_nichenet_liana.md`
- [ ] `assignments/assignment4_network_analysis.md`

---

## 5) Final Project

- [ ] `assignments/final_project.md`
- [ ] Deliverables:
  - [ ] `results/ccc_report.md` completed
  - [ ] method comparison + robustness notes
  - [ ] prioritized interaction shortlist + validation plan

---

## 6) Videos (Optional)

- [ ] Follow `resources/video_guide.md`

---

## If You Get Stuck

- [ ] Read “What Bad CCC Analysis Looks Like” in `course_cell_communication.md`
- [ ] Check: are your results driven by annotation quality, thresholds, or database choice?
